E. Forward/Backward Cases:

Checkpoints:

Smoke Testing : Every Time on survey load, generate new lead id, generate new trusted_form_url, map trusted form url with lead id

  1. PII to Survey, then back to PII, then forward to Survey
  2. On survey reload
  3. All question +ve answer -> tcpa opt-in -> expect lead posted
  4. All question +ve answer -> tcpa opt-out -> expect no lead posting
  5. All question -ve answer -> tcpa opt-in -> expect no lead posting (No Tag Leads will be posted)
  6. All question -ve answer -> tcpa opt-out -> expect no lead posting

I. Scenario: [yes, yes] (opt-in, opt-in | opt-out, opt-out)
  1. +ve respond -> tcpa opt-in -> back -> +ve respond -> tcpa opt-in -> expect lead posted once(lead_id1, trusted_form_url1)
  2. +ve respond -> tcpa opt-out -> back -> +ve respond -> tcpa opt-out -> expect no lead posting

II. Scenario: [yes, no] (opt-in, opt-in | opt-out, opt-out)
  1. +ve respond -> tcpa opt-in -> back -> -ve respond -> tcpa opt-in -> lead posted once(lead_id1, trusted_form_url1)
  2. +ve respond -> tcpa opt-out -> back -> -ve respond -> tcpa opt-out -> no lead posting

III. Scenario: [no, yes] (opt-in, opt-in | opt-out, opt-out)
  1. -ve respond -> tcpa opt-in -> back -> +ve respond -> tcpa opt-in -> no lead posting
  2. -ve respond -> tcpa opt-out -> back -> +ve respond -> tcpa opt-out -> no lead posting

IV. Scenario: [no, no] (opt-in, opt-in | opt-out, opt-out)
  1. -ve respond -> tcpa opt-in -> back -> -ve respond -> tcpa opt-in -> no lead posting
  2. -ve respond -> tcpa opt-out -> back -> -ve respond -> tcpa opt-out -> no lead posting

V. Scenario: [no, yes] (opt-in, opt-out | opt-out, opt-in)
  1. -ve respond -> tcpa opt-in -> back -> +ve respond -> tcpa opt-out -> no lead posting
  2. -ve respond -> tcpa opt-out -> back -> +ve respond -> tcpa opt-in -> no lead posting

VI. Scenario: [yes, no] (opt-in, opt-out | opt-out, opt-in)
  1. +ve respond -> tcpa opt-in -> back -> -ve respond -> tcpa opt-out -> lead posted once(lead_id1, trusted_form_url1)
  2. +ve respond -> tcpa opt-out -> back -> -ve respond -> tcpa opt-in -> no lead posting

F. Periodic check of Random Journaya IDs:
 Pick any random 6 journaya IDs from live data table tcpa_survey_optin and validate their entries in Journaya
                 -  Verify if the marketing partner names, disclaimer text, user actions are visible  

G. 3rd Party Integration Data Scrape Check:
Check all the API calls to Pushnami which are visible in the network tab and verify if no PII data is scraped from URL's query string and Localstorage.
- GET Check for https://api.pushnami.com/scripts/v1/hub
- POST Check for https://psp.pushnami.com/api/psp
- POST Check for https://trc.pushnami.com/api/push/track
- POST Check for https://api.pushnami.com/api/push/subscribe
2. For GET request check query string and Request Header's referrer of above URLs
3. For POST request check query string, request header's referrer and body/payload

I. Random E2E Recordings of Trusted forms along with Jornaya Logs:
Pick any random 3 trusterd_form_cert_url  from live data table tcpa_survey_optin and validate their entries in Journaya
Validate recording end to end, we should be able to see survey responses and optin in the recording

Issues Raised:
https://gitlab.com/cap_tech1/frontend/freesamplesprousa.com/-/issues/3163 - As discussed with @Sanket oswal the issue is still open. This is been highlighted to Dev/PM in the call

https://gitlab.com/cap_tech1/frontend/freesamplesprousa.com/-/issues/3393 - Discrepencies in Random Journaya Check - Raised Trello - https://trello.com/c/UMYX4Uq1/3517-discrepancies-in-journaya-wrt-to-statecode-and-code-of-gendervalue1

https://gitlab.com/cap_tech1/frontend/freesamplesprousa.com/-/issues/3632 - No Disclaimer/Disclosure seen in Journya ID


Notes & Known issues:
On the TCPA page, TCPAOPTIN is "ON" by default
If the user has opted out, There is no log in jornaya
Even after clearing user data and cookies, the jornaya id recorder in TCPA survey optin db is the same, hence the logs are appended to it
user DOB and gender is logged in jornaya from the PII section
For PreTCPA, we don't have any log if a user clicked on continue
Jornaya for Pre-TCPA flow also logs FULL_TCPA disclosure at the end i.e we can see FULL_TCPA text even if its not shown in the flow

- Lead Posting working fine
- Discrepancy in Journaya,
